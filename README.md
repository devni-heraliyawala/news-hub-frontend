## Description
This project demonstrate a simple NEWS hub feature which was given as a SSE technical test at Codification using [News API](https://newsapi.org/). (Backend only). 

This project is a simple application of [News API](https://newsapi.org/) for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.

- Article discovery and analysis using [Everything](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything) endpoint.
- Retrieve live top and breaking headlines using [Top-Headlines](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) endpoint.
- Retrieve publishers available on the API using [Sources](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources) endpoint.
- Retrieve articles according to the filter criterias
- Import favourite articles
- Display a detailed view of a imported article


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
